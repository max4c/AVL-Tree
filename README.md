# AVL-Tree

an AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree, and it was the first such data structure to be invented. In an AVL tree, the heights of the two subtrees of any node differ by at most one. Lookup, insertion, and deletion all take O(log n) time in both the average and worst cases, where n is the number of nodes in the tree prior to the operation. Insertions and deletions may require the tree to be rebalanced by one or more tree rotations.

* Implemented the interface creating an AVL tree. Rebalanced when the subtree heights are off by more than 1 (i.e. the balance of a node is greater than 1 or less than -1).
* Properly removed from the AVL tree
* Maintained the balance of the tree
